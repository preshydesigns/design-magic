# design-magic
Getting started with Figma , read!
key factors to note.

It's free for individuals (and is dirt cheap for teams)
It's web-based.
It offers a downloadable native desktop app (it uses Electron to achieve this)
It offers both UI & Prototyping, instead of just design.
It has strong vector features.
It also just works. Other tools are lacking in quite obvious areas, but Figma is very well rounded. All of the typical keyboard shortcuts that you expect to be present in a UI design tool are there, and there are no major issues as far as I've seen.
